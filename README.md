# AZ-400-Study
When I was studying for the AZ-400 I wrote down A LOT of hand written notes - old school pen and paper. 
Studying for me was attacking it from allsides: course videos, practice exams, Mircosoft learning path, home labs for hands-on experience, documentation, images, and note taking. 
After I filled an entire notebook with notes and threw away multiple pens I thought I'd take the notes that helped the most and place them in a repo. 

## Step 1 - Learning Order
The great thing about this exam is that Microsoft tells you what skills will be measured and how much each skill is weighted towards your exam. 
New information is always overwhelming, but breaking things down into manageable chunks helps out tremendously. 

## Step 2 - Practice, Practice, Practice
When watching a video: listen and manually write down what you learned with a pen and paper. 
When taking practice exams: know "why" your answer is the correct answer and be able to explain why the other answers wouldn't be a solution. 
Being able to walk through different questions won't only help with the exam, but it will also help you in the real world, which, is a big reason for getting certified. 

## Step 3 - Make Learning Fun/Funny
This helped out BIG TIME. Have fun with the process and find silly ways to help remember concepts. 

For example - **the difference between Lead Time & Cycle Time Widget**:
Lead time measures the total time elapsed from the creation of work items to their completion. Cycle time measures the time it takes for your team to complete work items once they begin actively working on them.
My uncle is big into Tour de France - so I connected Lead Time to the entire Tour de France race & connected Cycle time to when a cyclist hops on their bike and starts the ride. 

**What functionality does OWASP ZAP provide in a pipeline?**
It would be **P**assive **P**en test's - OWAS**P** ZA**P**


## Step 4 - Go through the [Microsoft Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-400/)
Seriously, take your time and go through the Learning Path - read through and do the labs to get hands on experience. 
Videos are great to hear someone teach a topic, reading documentation helps comprehend the information, hands-on experience helps my going through implementation and actually clicking the buttons, and writing concepts/new information helps with drilling the information into your cranium. 
Microsoft does a great job by telling you what skills are measured, which is great because this helps by breaking studying down into manageable chunks.
