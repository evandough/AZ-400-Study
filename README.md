# AZ-400-Study
When I was studying for the AZ-400 I wrote down A LOT of hand written notes - old school pen and paper. 
Studying for me was attacking it from allsides: course videos, practice exams, Mircosoft learning path, home labs, and note taking. 
After I filled an entire notebook with notes and threw away multiple pens I thought I'd take the notes that helped the most and place them in a repo.
